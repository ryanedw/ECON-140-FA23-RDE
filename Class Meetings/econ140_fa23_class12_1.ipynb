    "Paternal age, `fathage`, is correlated with many things in the CPP data. One of them that really stands out is paternal education, `fathyrseduc`, and in the auxiliary regression, we see that $\\pi_1 \\approx -0.1$. Each additional year of paternal age was associated with a reduction in paternal education of about a tenth of a year.\n",
    "\n",
    "Why? In a cross section especially in the earlier time period of the CPP, older dads are likely to be the ones <i>still</i> having children. Dad's education and socioeconomic status would likely reduce family size, possibly by raising desired spending and education per child, which is sometimes called \"child quality.\"\n",
    "\n",
    "Further, we also see that paternal education, `fathyrseduc`, exerts a positive influence on kids' test scores. In the long regression, $\\lambda \\approx 1.6$, meaning a little over an additional point and a half on the test for each additional year of paternal education. \n",
    "\n",
    "Why? Paternal and maternal education could proxy for time investments in the child, or they might proxy for biological inheritance of \"smarts\" or something. Family economists usually think it's the former, but it could be nature or nurture. Either way, we see a positive relationship there."

    "It does not seem plausible at all that sperm mutations cause lower test scores for kids through the channel of paternal education, which is likely determined far in advance of deleterious mutations in sperm. If that view is correct, then if paternal education is not controlled for, it is an omitted variable that is negatively correlated with paternal age and positively correlated with kids' test scores. That negative bias creates a coefficient on paternal age in the short regression, $\\beta^s$, which is too negative. \n",
