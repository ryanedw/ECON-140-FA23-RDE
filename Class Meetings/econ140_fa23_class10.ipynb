    "As is often the case, including more variables $Z$ on the right-hand side of the regression equation often reduces the magnitudes and statistical significance of coefficients we care about, like on a key treatment variable $X$.\n",

    "<b>The problem</b> is deciding whether the $Z$'s belong there or not. Are they potentially omitted variables that would obscure the true story about $\\beta$, the effect of $X$ on $Y$, if they were omitted? Or are they bad controls, which block off a critical channel of causality running between $X$ and $Y$?\n",
    "\n",
    "An <b>omitted variable</b> is a $Z$ that should be there, and by its omission is biasing the story about the causal effect of $X$ on the outcome $Y$. A classic example would be a parental characteristic that varies with the treatment variable; the thought experiment is: suppose a policy changed $X$ for kids, despite important parental characteristics $Z$ being what they are. What is the likely effect of the policy on $Y$?\n",
    "\n",
    "A <b>bad control</b> is a $Z$ that shouldn't be there, because controlling for it blocks off a critical pathway through which $X$ causes $Y$. A great example might be $Z = occupation$ and/or industry in a regression of $Y = earnings$ on $X = education$. Education raises earnings in part because it moves people out of engaging in manual labor and into services and other industries. It might be true that a highly educated janitor could be more productive and thus earn more than a poorly educated janitor, but it is the transition from janitor to something like an office worker, doctor, or lawyer that really raises earnings a lot. If we control for occupation and industry in an earnings regression, we will be closing off that pathway of switching occupations or industries, through which we imagine education has a large causal effect on earnings."
