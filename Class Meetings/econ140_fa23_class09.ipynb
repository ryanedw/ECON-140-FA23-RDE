    "The point of this exercise was to explore the supposition that family size might be an omitted variable in the [Dale and Krueger (2002)](https://www-jstor-org.libproxy.berkeley.edu/stable/4132484), as posited by Angrist and Pischke in <i>Mastering Metrics</i> on pp 72-74.\n",
    "\n",
    "Here are some takeaways:\n",
    "\n",
    "<b>Angrist and Pischke's guesses are shrewd</b>, and they reveal the usefulness of the OVB formula in thinking through robustness. It is very plausible that if family size $FS$ were omitted from this long regression of log earnings on private school attendance and other things:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$\n",
    "\\ln Y_i = \\alpha^l \n",
    "+ \\beta^l \\ P_i + \n",
    "\\sum_j \\gamma_j^l GROUP_{ji} \n",
    "+ \\delta_1^l SAT_i\n",
    "+ \\delta_2^l \\ln PI_i\n",
    "+ \\lambda FS_i\n",
    "+ e^l_i\n",
    "$$\n",
    "\n",
    "then the omission may produce positive bias in $\\beta^s$ from a short regression. Why? You have to have two things:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. We need $\\gamma < 0$ meaning family size reduces earnings\n",
    "\n",
    "2. We need $\\pi_1 < 0$ meaning private school attendance falls with family size\n",
    "\n",
    "When these are both true, then $OVB = \\pi_1 \\times \\gamma > 0$ and thus $\\beta^s$ will be too positive relative to the true $\\beta$. (Another way this could work is if both $\\gamma$ and $\\pi_1$ were positive, but that does not seem likely.)\n",
    "\n",
    "Both assumptions are plausible. \n",
    "\n",
    "<b>But HRS data suggests family size does not <u>independently</u> affect earnings: $\\gamma = 0$</b>. I think this is because family size affects earnings through education. Here, for example, is another look at this: let's model earnings as a function of `r4livsib` in the full HRS sample, omitting education:"

    "\n",
    "The bottom line that I take away from this is that <i><b>family size is probably not an omitted variable in the Dale and Krueger (2002) study</b></i>, \"getting off on a technicality,\" as it were. Because their cohort uniformly attended college, a big channel through which siblings matter for earnings, namely education, was shut off. In the long regression, the coefficient on family size, $\\gamma$, is statistically indistinguishable from zero. \n",

    "<b>An open question is whether the sample matters.</b> This is always a concern for applied research, and we usually call it <i>external validity</i>, whether a result from a certain sample is something that can be generalized beyond the sample, or external to it, to the broader human experience."
