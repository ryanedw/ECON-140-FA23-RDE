As they remark in their opening paragraph, however, population-level or average measures outcome do not show much of a jump at age 65, despite the jump in Medicare eligibility:\n",
    "\n",
    "> Medicare pays nearly one-fifth of total health care costs in the United States. Yet evidence on the health effects of the program is limited. Studies of aggregate death rates before and after the introduction of Medicare show little indication of a program impact (Finkelstein and McKnight 2005). The age profiles of mortality and self-reported health in the population as a whole are likewise remarkably smooth around the eligibility threshold at age 65 (Card, Dobkin, and Maestas 2004; Dow 2004). Although existing research has shown that the utilization of health care services increases once people become eligible for Medicare (e.g., Decker and Rapaport [2002], McWilliams et al. [2003, 2007], Card, Dobkin, and Maestas [2004]), the health impact of these additional services remains uncertain.\n",

Then they examine restricted-access datasets covering hospital admissions via emergency departments in California and elsewhere. We can examine the former but not the latter."
