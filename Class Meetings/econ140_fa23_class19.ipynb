    "In the long-long ago of Fall 1993, I completed the equivalent of ECON 140 at college. The first term was led that year by Henry Farber, while Orley Ashenfelter taught econometric applications for undergraduates in Spring 1994, which is roughly equivalent to ECON c142. At Berkeley, David Card led ECON c142 before his retirement from teaching after Spring 2022. Typically, Farber taught the second term while Ashenfelter taught the first term, but in this year they had switched.\n",
