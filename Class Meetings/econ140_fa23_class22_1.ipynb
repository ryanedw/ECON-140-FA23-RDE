    "<b>In 2014</b>, New Jersey raised its minimum wage from \\\\$7.25 to \\\\$8.25, and then a little more thereafter, to keep up with inflation. Like before, Pennsylvania left its minimum wage alone. Both times series can be found on the St. Louis Fed FRED website: [for NJ](https://fred.stlouisfed.org/series/STTMINWGNJ) and [for PA](https://fred.stlouisfed.org/series/STTMINWGPA). With a little extra work, one can quickly edit one of those two graphs to show both series together.\n",

Labor surveys like the Current Population Survey (CPS) and American Community Survey (ACS) measure employment at a point in time, usually \"last week,\" while earnings are usually either reported for the previous year (ACS) or a different time period (CPS). A measure of employment in New Jersey in the 2014 wave of ACS indicates the average level of employment during the year, and thus it should fully reflect conditions under the increased minimum wage."
